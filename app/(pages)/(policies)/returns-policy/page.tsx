            Our policy does not exclude or replace your rights under Consumer Guarantees of the Australian Consumer Law, regulations or otherwise as required by law. Returns outside of the Consumer Guarantees will be at the discretion of Triumvirs Academia.
SECTION 1 - CONDITIONS FOR RETURN OF GOODS
Triumvirs Academia will only provide returns for goods (physical and digital) only if it constitutes a major failure under Australian Consumer Law or at the discretion of Triumvirs Academia. A major failure with goods is when:
•	a reasonable consumer would not have bought the goods if they had known about the problem. For example, no reasonable consumer would buy a washing machine if they knew the motor was going to burn out after three months;
•	the goods are significantly different from the description, sample or demonstration model shown to the consumer. For example, a consumer orders a red bicycle from a catalogue, but the bicycle delivered is green;
•	the goods are substantially unfit for their normal purpose and cannot easily be made fit, within a reasonable time. For example, a ski jacket is not waterproof because it is made from the wrong material;
•	the goods are substantially unfit for a purpose that the consumer told the supplier about, and cannot easily be made fit within a reasonable time. For example, a car is not powerful enough to tow the consumer&apos;s boat because its engine is too small—despite the consumer telling the supplier they needed the car to tow a boat;
•	the goods are unsafe. For example, an electric blanket has faulty wiring.
SECTION 2 - CONDITIONS FOR RETURN OF SERVICES
Triumvirs Academia will only provide returns for services only if it constitutes a major failure under Australian Consumer Law or at the discretion of Triumvirs Academia. A major failure with services is when:
•	a reasonable consumer would not have acquired the services if they had known the nature and extent of the problem. For example, a reasonable consumer would not pay to have acrylic nails attached if they knew the nails would fall off within an hour;
•	the services are substantially unfit for their normal purpose and cannot easily be made fit for such a purpose, within a reasonable time. For example, a carpet-cleaning service changes the colour of the consumer&apos;s carpet in some places;
•	the consumer told the supplier they wanted the service for a specific purpose but the service, and any resulting product, do not achieve that purpose and the service cannot easily and within a reasonable time be made to achieve such a purpose. For example, a consumer tells a pay TV company they are specifically buying the service because they want to watch the Olympics. They sign up to a 24-month contract but the Olympics are over before the company installs the service;
•	the consumer told the supplier they wanted a specific result but the services, and any resulting product, do not achieve that result and the service cannot easily and within a reasonable time be made to achieve such a result. For example, a consumer asks a technician to increase the memory capacity of a computer within one week. When installing an extra drive, the technician damages the hard drive. Repairs will take six weeks but the consumer needs the computer within a week;
•	the supply of the services has created an unsafe situation. For example, an electrician incorrectly wires wall sockets in a consumer&apos;s new kitchen, which makes the electrical outlets unsafe.
